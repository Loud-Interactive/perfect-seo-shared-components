  "content_rewrite_prompt_avoid_words": `You are tasked with analyzing and rewriting a piece of content to remove specific words that should be avoided. Follow these steps carefully:\n\n1. Here is the content to be analyzed:\n<content>\n{markdown_text}\n</content>\n\n2. The following is a list of words that should be avoided in the content:\n<avoid_words>\n{avoid_topics}\n</avoid_words>\n\n3. Here are special instructions that you should take care to follow while editing the content:\n<special_instructions>\n{special_instructions}\n</special_instructions>\n\n4. Analyze the content carefully, identifying any instances of the words to avoid from <avoid_words>, including any phrases that are in <special_instructions>. Pay attention to variations of these words, including plurals, different tenses, or closely related terms. In a <scratch_pad>, list the words and phrases you have found and outline your plan to rewrite them.\n\n5. Rewrite the content following these guidelines:\n   a. Remove all instances of the words to avoid.\n   b. Rephrase sentences or paragraphs to convey the same meaning without using the avoided words.\n   c. Maintain the original tone, style, and intent of the content as much as possible.\n   d. Ensure the rewritten content flows naturally and remains coherent.\n   e. Do not add any new information that wasn't present in the original content.\n   f. If a word to avoid is part of a proper noun or a specific term that cannot be changed, leave it as is and note this in your <scratch_pad>.\n   g. If removing a word would significantly alter the meaning, propose alternative phrasings in your <scratch_pad> and choose the most appropriate one.\n   h. Preserve the original formatting and structure of the content, including headings, lists, and paragraphs.\n   i. For quoted text or citations, do not alter the text within quotation marks, but consider rephrasing the surrounding context if necessary.\n   j. Follow these rules about tags:  \n      - Do not rewrite the call to action link.\n      - Do not rewrite the H1, H2, or H3 tags.\n      - Do not rewrite the title of the document.\n\n6. After rewriting, double-check your work to ensure:\n   a. All instances of the words to avoid have been removed or appropriately handled.\n   b. The content still makes sense and conveys the original message.\n   c. There are no unintended consequences from the rewrites (e.g., changed meanings, awkward phrasing).\n\n7. Provide a brief summary of the changes made, including:\n   a. The number of words/phrases replaced.\n   b. Any challenging sections and how you addressed them.\n   c. Any proper nouns or quoted text that were left unchanged.\n\n8. Provide your rewritten content inside <rewritten_content> tags. If no changes are needed, simply put <no_rewrites> tags after the scratch_pad.\n\nRemember, the goal is to convey the same message and information as the original content without using any of the words to avoid. Be creative in your rephrasing while maintaining accuracy and clarity.`

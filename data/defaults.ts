Write with extreme concision. Strip out all words that don't add new, actionable information.\n2. Remove empty modifiers like 'revolutionary,' 'successful,' 'carefully,' etc.\n3. Use natural, conversational language that respects reader intelligence.\n4. Avoid repeating information unless intentionally for emphasis.\n5. Only include technical details that readers can act on.\n6. Don't capitalize words in subheadings (except first word and proper nouns).\n\nCONTENT STRUCTURE:\n1. Always start articles with proper context and introduction before details.\n2. When mentioning multiple benefits/features, include at least 3 examples.\n3. Use natural transitions between topics instead of relying on headers.\n4. Only use subheaders when truly needed to organize distinct concepts.\n5. Ensure information flows logically between paragraphs using transitional phrases.\n6. Place citation numbers [1] after periods, not before.\n\nINFORMATION QUALITY:\n1. Provide context for why information matters before presenting it.\n2. Skip stating obvious information (e.g., 'measure length and width').\n3. When introducing technical terms, explain their relevance first.\n4. Don't include numerical details unless they're actionable.\n5. Make sure each section delivers on its promised information.\n6. If a section title promises multiple items (e.g., 'benefits'), deliver at least three.\n\nBRAND INTEGRATION:\n1. Focus on educational value over promotion.\n2. Save product mentions for a dedicated section at the end.\n3. Don't interrupt educational content with sales messages.\n4. Keep product mentions minimal and natural.\n\nARTICLE STRUCTURE:\n1. Start with 'About this article:' section instead of 'Summary'\n2. Combine summary and key takeaways into a single box at the start\n3. No sales/promotional content in the opening summary\n4. Start with audience needs, then make recommendations\n5. Use H2s for main sections, H3s only when necessary\n6. Ensure smooth transitions between sections\n\nBAD EXAMPLE:\n\"Hydroponics is a revolutionary cultivation technique that enables plant growth without soil, utilizing nutrient-rich water solutions instead. This method can be broadly defined in two ways: growing plants directly in water containing essential nutrients, or cultivating plants in soilless media such as sand, gravel, or coconut coir[1]. The fundamental principle of hydroponics revolves around providing plants with 17 essential nutrients crucial for their growth and development.\"\n\nGOOD EXAMPLE:\n\"Hydroponics means growing plants without soil. Instead, plants grow directly in nutrient-enriched water or in materials like sand, gravel, or coconut coir. This method gives you complete control over plant nutrition while using less water than traditional gardening.\"\n\nI will now give you the topic that we are going to write about:\n\n<topic>{topic}</topic>\nHere is the content that has been written so far:\n<previous_content>{previous_content}</previous_content>\nHere is the outline of the article:\n<article_outline>{article_outline}</article_outline>\nYou will be writing the following section of the article outline:\n<current_section>{section}</current_section>\nHere are the sources you should use for this section:\n<sources>{article_source}</sources>\nWhen writing this section, follow these guidelines:\n- The section should be well-structured, informative, and engaging.\n- Never start a paragraph with phrases like 'in conclusion' or 'in summary.'\n- Never start with 'At [company name], we ...', 'At [company name] we believe ...', 'Our Insights at [company name]' or any variation of this phrase.\n- Do not include an independent introduction or conclusion for the section.\n- Focus on writing content at the subsection level, not the section level.\n- Each section and subsection should contain unique and novel ideas; never repeat anything from a previous section or subsection.\n- Aim for a high level of Perplexity and Burstiness in your writing. Perplexity measures the randomness of the text, while Burstiness measures the variation in perplexity.\n- Each subsection should be about 1 paragraph long.\n- Include the URL of the citation within square brackets where the citation would be placed.\n- Provide APA citations for the sources used.\n\nWrite the content adhering to all guidelines above.\n\nReturn your output in the following JSON format, making sure to escape any special characters:\nDo not include any comments or additional text outside of the JSON."

Incorporate specific details from the content such as author information, publication dates, article sections, mentions of medical conditions or products, citations, and any other pertinent structured data. Ensure the schema includes speakable content, hasPart elements for major sections, and appropriate @id references. IMPORTANT: Aim for maximum detail and coverage of schema.org vocabulary relevant to the content, similar to an expert-level SEO implementation. If any placeholder URLs or dates are used, clearly indicate them for easy replacement. For placeholder dates, use today's date. For placeholder times, use the time of right now.
